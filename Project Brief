SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a powerful tool for real-time monitoring, threat detection, and centralised visibility.

Incident prioritisation is crucial – strategic decision-making ensures resources focus on real threats.

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy, sophisticated attacks requiring multi-layered defence strategies.

Data ingestion in SIEM involves collecting, normalising, and analysing logs, analogous to organising a library for clarity and actionability.

APT detection demands defence-in-depth techniques like anomaly detection, vulnerability assessments, and network audits.

Prioritising incidents requires tools and methods partaking similar to triage, considering impact, urgency, and compliance needs.
